# Henntober Art Portfolio

## About

This project was created as a gallery/portfolio for helloitsrufio's (Ruth Reed) hobby artwork. This artwork is currently stored on her [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/henntober/) under the handle *henntober*, hence the repo name.

Within Rufio's Twitch community, there is a currency of sorts called channel points. These are a way to reward viewers for their viewership. When viewers watch a stream and interact with it, they earn these points. Most Twitch streamers have 'redemptions' for these channel points, or a way to spend them. One of Rufio's redemptions is a custom henna-style postcard. 

The problem that Rufio was running into, however, was a good way to show these postcards when viewers redeemed the postcard redemption. This project was created to solve that problem by allowing viewers easy access to all the potential postcards they could redeem via a gallery-style art portfolio.

This project was coded in public on [Rufio's Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/helloitsrufio).
